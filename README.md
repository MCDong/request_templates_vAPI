# request_templates_vAPI

Request templates for the vAPI,https://github.com/mattvaldes/vulnerable-api.

These templates can be used by automated API security testing tools like Syntribos https://github.com/openstack/syntribos to test and make the tool better.
The vAPI is also a good source to learn, *what not to do* when designing a API.
